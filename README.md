# sourcemod-syskill
Leverages the [System2 Extension](https://github.com/dordnung/System2/releases/latest) (REQUIRED) to call the linux `kill` command on the running srcds instance

Obviously this only works on linux, and requires your server to have access to the bash shell. If your server doesn't have access to the bash shell, consider your life choices and install bash.

Example usage:
